# Predicting-wine-quality
Winemaking is a very complex process that requires consideration of both physical and chemical factors in order to produce wines of the highest quality. So, it is of interest to winemakers to try to optimize their wines to be enjoyed by the greatest number of people. In other words, winemakers want to create wines that are highly rated by most. This is beneficial not only for winemakers, but for consumers as well. It is useful, then, for winemakers to try to know how their wines will be rated, based on some of the measurable characteristics of the wine. This is the motivation behind the analysis we will conduct; we want to try to answer the following question: “How well can wine quality be predicted based on the various physiochemical properties of the wine?” If wine quality can be predicted well using the created model, then winemakers might be able to “score” their own wine without having to rely on professional tasters, saving them time and money
